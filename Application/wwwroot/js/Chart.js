//so first the data has to be sent here either from a controller or something of that nature
//in json format


//then next we would parse that data in from json to a javascript object so that 
//the chart js library can make sense of it


//Pass that data through to a method that will be understood by the chart js library




//Get Data to display to view w/ third party library
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------


/*How can I convert the data from my database into JSON format?
    first we would have to retrive the data from the database 
    then we can serialize the data
    JSON format. After serialization it can then be reconstructed
    to fit the needs of chart js*/

//we should start by implementing the basic logic structure to be formatted into the third party library
//from that point we can then render all necessary assets to the users view


/*Once converted how would I pass that data through? From where and to where?
    */
//What is ajax and what is it used for?
//In the context of chart js, how can I display multiple charts?
//How can I make these charts update dynamically?

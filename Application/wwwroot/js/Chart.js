//so first the data has to be sent here either from a controller or something of that nature
//in json format


//then next we would parse that data in from json to a javascript object so that 
//the chart js library can make sense of it


//Pass that data through to a method that will be understood by the chart js library




//Get Data to display to view w/ third party library
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//How can I convert the data from my database into JSON format?
//Once converted how would I pass that data through? From where and to where?
//What is ajax and what is it used for?
//In the context of chart js, how can I display multiple charts?
//How can I make these charts update dynamically?
